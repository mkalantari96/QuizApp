## React Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights several advanced React concepts and best practices:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaks down the UI into reusable components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: Uses the `useState` hook for managing local and complex states within components.
- **Side Effects Management**: Utilizes `useEffect` for handling side effects such as fetching quiz data from an API and updating the document title.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS and media queries to create a responsive layout that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
